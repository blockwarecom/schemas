      An executable block provides a type of block that does not get deployed as a service. 
      This is typically a command line tool, a desktop block or a mobile app.
      What's also common for executable blocks is that they do not have direct access to other
      service blocks, and can't rely on other services or software being available at runtime.
      They are also typically distributed as a downloadable artifact - like a setup file or a package.
