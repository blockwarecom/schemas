      A block type operator provides a type of block that does not require code to be written.
      This can be anywhere from a HTTP gateway to a database block.
      Note that most databases can more easily be implemented as a resource operator. 
      Blocks are good for representing more complex scenarios where there are connections between this and other services.
      Message queues, for example, are a good example of something that could be an operator block.

              Determines the type of operator. 
              "logical" means the operator is a logical component and won't necessarily actually create a service.
              "instance" means the operator is an instance and will create a service and be connectable to one or more operators.

              The primary port is the one that will be used to access the operator.
